# Project Idea

JKV has an established long-term relationship with a local lawn care company, providing them with engineering and fabrication support for their fleet of equipment. As we became familiar with their equipment and use case, we started to see a business case for an electric fertilizer spreader.

# The Result

This completed E-Spreader is easy to use, and lasts all day (8 Hours on a full charge). The machine is easy to operate using a single joy stick for acceleration, decelaration, and turning.

The E-Spreader is powered by a couple of Dakota Lithium batteries (available for puchase at the [JKV Shop](https://shop.jkvengineering.com)), for a total of 48 Volt and 192 Ah, or 9.2 Kw.

Everything about the machine, including power management, maneuvability, etc., is all programmed by JKV and therefore fully customizable. 

That's one of the greatest advantages of working with JKV - from concept, to the physical build, to the software programming, we can handle it all and are fully commited to perfecting it until our customers are happy, and we are proud of it.

# What's Next?

We are putting in the miles to test its robustness, operability, and to look for opportunities of further refinement. So far, we all agree that this machine is impressive!

We are looking for potential customers of the E-Spreader. Do you work in the lawn care industry, or do you know of someone who does? If so, please [get in touch](/contact) with us!
