Shohei Shibata graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 2006. Since then, he has spent much of his career in the automotive industry, designing and developing safety critical chassis and suspension components for major OEMs. The experience has trained him well in the technical know-how of structural design, but he is always curious and learning new things. But in anything he does, he believes that listening, observing, and seeing the big picture is more important than any technical engineering knowledge.

If he isn't working on a JKV project, you will probably find him working in the garden, or playing jazz drums.
