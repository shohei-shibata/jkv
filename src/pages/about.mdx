## Rapid, Engineered, Prototypes

...for companies developing new products.   Our unique advantage is that we produce high quality designs, bills of materials, CAD models, and drawings, in the same building where we have significant manufacturing capability.  At the end of a project we deliver a well organized engineering package along with a very high quality, functional prototype.  Often these first articles along with the engineering package are extremely useful to help our customers quickly bring new products to market.

## Systems Engineering

JKV has offered full systems engineering under one roof since it was started.  This means physical equipment with sensors, and feedback motion control.  We gained this expertise developing control systems for vehicle applications including, powertrain control, engine control, thermal management system control, HVAC, and more.  We save our customers time and money by helping to design the physical system and then the electrical design, sensor package, control loops, and HMIs.    We can develop control systems on embedded microprocessors or PLCs.
