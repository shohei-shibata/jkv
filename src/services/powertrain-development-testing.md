JKV Engineering has experience with power transmission systems from robotic joints to vehicle power-train development and in the loop testing. We've been involved with hybrid power-train work since 2008 when we developed and tested multiple hydraulic hybrid drive-trains for vocational vehicles. Since then we've worked on multiple hybrid electric power-train systems, as well as performance automotive and industrial equipment power-trains. JKV has developed power-train systems from full vehicle mathematical models through to power-train component design and control systems development.
