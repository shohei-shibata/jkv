JKV Engineering offers its engineering services for the adaptation of internal combustion engine systems into special applications. Aside from a background in powersports and classic performance car restoration, JKV engineers have adapted engine systems for use in hybrid vehicles, range extended electric vehicles, diesel re-powered to CNG busses, as well as pump and power applications. We have experience working with engineers from OEM car manufacturers to integrate engines and their subsystems into vehicles and other applications elegantly and reliably.
