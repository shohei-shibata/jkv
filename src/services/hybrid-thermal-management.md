JKV Engineering has extensive experience developing fluid power and fluid conveyance systems for a variety of applications. We have designed and implemented systems including brewery “Clean in Place” systems, hybrid vehicle fuel systems, and hydro-pneumatic energy recovery for heavy duty hybrid vehicles. We’ve applied all of this experience to the design of thermal management systems for electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The cost, reliability, and efficiency of these systems has an enormous bearing on those parameters for the overall vehicle.
