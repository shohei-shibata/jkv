In our work in automotive research and development projects, we often design around power dense systems. Instantaneous power requirements for vehicles can be many times greater than the requirements for relatively large buildings. The automotive environment also requires safety, reliability, and performance that is more than adequate for other power systems such as residential and commercial buildings. While there are tremendous opportunities to incorporate renewable energy into automotive applications a very large portion of the energy that we use on a daily basis is taken from the buildings where we live and work.
