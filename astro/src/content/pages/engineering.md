__We are experts in electric drive systems and alternative fuel systems.__

But no matter what kind of engineering project you are about to tackle, we would love to see how we can contribute to your success.

We are capable of designing and prototyping an EV from ground up. But helping our clients achieve their goals is satisfying no matter how big or small the project.

# Concept Development

Initial planning is crucial to the final outcome of an engineering project. We understand that we are supporting your project, and helping to achieve your goals. We will listen to what you are looking to accomplish, then engage in discussions with you about conceptual direction and our scope of work. We will produce concept selection matrices and other documents are requested.

We are always happy to have some initial exploratory conversations as part of our project quoting process. So don't hesitate to [reach out to us](/contact) today to start that discussion.

# Product Design and Analysis

Combined, we have decades of design experiences in automotive and other industries. 

From 3D CAD modeling, CAE (simulation and mathematical modeling), DFMEA, BoMs, drawing packages and more, we have supported clients around the US and globally, whether it's a weeks-long or a multi-year project.

__We are a full systems engineering provider.__

JKV has offered full systems engineering under one roof since it was started. This means physical equipment with sensors, and feedback motion control. We gained this expertise through developing control systems for vehicle applications including: powertrain control, engine control, thermal management system control, HVAC, and more. We save our customers time and money by helping to design the physical system and then the electrical design, sensor package, control loops, and HMIs. We can develop control systems on embedded microprocessors or PLCs.

# Project Management

Our goal is beyond merely handling tasks. We do everything with your goal for the project in mind. 

In fact, in an ideal engagement we would be given a portion of a project for us to manage independently. That way you do not need to micro-manage us (but you will be provided with project status throughout). 

# Prototyping and Testing

Our unique advantage is that we produce high quality designs, bills of materials, CAD models, and drawings in the same building where we have significant manufacturing capability. At the end of a project we deliver a well organized engineering package along with a very high quality, functional prototype. Often these first articles along with the engineering package are extremely useful to help our customers quickly bring new products to market.
